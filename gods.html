  <h1 class="text">The Gods</h1>
  <p class="text">
      Long ago the world was created by the eight gods and goddesses of the 
      Circle. They were bored by the static dealings of Good and Evil, and 
      sought to entertain themselves with the creatures they created, to whom 
      they granted free will and uncertainty of purpose.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
      In the ages that followed the free willed races who name their kin, 
      collectively called the Namers, fought many long and terrible wars on the 
      behalf of their deities. Their zealotry was unquenchable, and the Circle 
      knew that for their creation to survive their influence must be dimmed. 
      They cast themselves into a deep sleep, that they could still watch over 
      the world in their dreams, but their terrible wills would not permeate 
      the Namers so. Thus began the Age of Slumber.
